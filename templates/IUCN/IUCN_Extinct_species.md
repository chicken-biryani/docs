## Input

### History
The initial aim was to compare the number of threatened species per species over time (e.g. number of pandas per year).

After a lot of research, it turns out that this kind of data is not available or it is only data from one year (2015 or 2018).

Therefore, we decided to start another project: Number of threatened species per year, with details by category using data from this site : https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/summary-statistics#Summary%20Tables

So we took the pdf from this site and turned it into a csv.
But the data was heavy and not easy to use. Moreover, we thought that this would not necessarily be viable and adaptable over time.

So we decided to take another datasource on a similar subject : *Extinct Species*, from this website : https://www.iucnredlist.org/statistics

**Tags:** #iucn #opendata #extinctspecies

### Import library


```python
import pandas as pd
```

### Test with 'read_html' 
We couldn't use it cause there's too many tabs in the page (it'll take too long).


```python
url = "https://www.iucnredlist.org/statistics"

#dfs = pd.read_html(url)
#df = dfs[0]

#df
```

## Model

### We use CSV file
CSV button on this link to download the file: https://www.iucnredlist.org/statistics


```python
# We load the csv file (must be root)
data = pd.read_csv('Table 3 Species by kingdom and class - show all.csv',',')
# We set the column Name as index
data.set_index('Name', inplace = True)
# Then we select the columns EX, EW and Name, and all the lines we want in the graph
table = data.loc[["Total",
                  "GASTROPODA",
                  "BIVALVIA",
                  "AVES",
                  "MAMMALIA",
                  "ACTINOPTERYGII",
                  "CEPHALASPIDOMORPHI",
                  "INSECTA",
                  "AMPHIBIA",
                  "REPTILIA",
                  "ARACHNIDA",
                  "CLITELLATA",
                  "DIPLOPODA",
                  "ENOPLA",
                  "TURBELLARIA",
                 "MALACOSTRACA",
                 "MAXILLOPODA",
                 "OSTRACODA"]# add species here
                 ,"EX":"EW"]
table
```


```python
# We add a new column 'CATEGORY' to our Dataframe
table["CATEGORY"] = ["Total",
                     "Molluscs",
                     "Molluscs",
                     "Birds",
                     "Mammals",
                     "Fishes",
                     "Fishes",
                     "Insects",
                     "Amphibians",
                     "Reptiles",
                      "Others",
                      "Others",
                      "Others",
                      "Others",
                      "Others",
                    "Crustaceans",
                    "Crustaceans",
                    "Crustaceans"]
table = table.loc[:,["CATEGORY","EX"]] # we drop the column "EW"
table
# ---NOTE : If you want to add new species, you have to also add his category
```


```python
# We groupby CATEGORIES :
table.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
table = table.groupby(['CATEGORY']).sum().reset_index()
table.rename(columns = {'EX':'Extincted'}, inplace=True)
table
```

## Output

### Graph


```python
# We use plotly to show datas with an horizontal bar chart
import plotly.express as px

def print_graph():
    Graph = table.sort_values('Extincted', ascending=False)
    fig = px.bar(Graph, x="Extincted", y="CATEGORY", color="CATEGORY", orientation="h")
    fig.update_layout(title_text = "Number of species that have gone extinct since 1500", title_x = 0.5)
    fig.add_annotation(x=800, y=0,text="Source : IUCN Red List of Threatened Species<br>https://www.iucnredlist.org/statistics",showarrow=False)
    fig.show()
    
print_graph()
```
